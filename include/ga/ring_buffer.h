/*****************************************************************
                    LOCK FREE SPSC RING BUFFER

  A lock free ring buffer for a single producer thread and a
  single consumer thread.

  No (heap) memory allocation is performed in the ring_buffer (after creation).

  It is always safe to call the read and write functions
  (ga_ring_buffer_read, ga_ring_buffer_write etc),
  in the sense that the calls will never crash or block
  - with the exception that calling them with a bytes value
  bigger than the size of the ring buffer results in undefined behavior.

  ga_ring_buffer_write writes the passed number of bytes from the
  passed data buffer into the ring buffer, or until the ring buffer
  is full. It returns the number of bytes actually written.

  ga_ring_buffer_write_atomic works like ga_ring_buffer_write,
  except it's a all-or-nothing: if the complete buffer cannot
  be written, the function returns 0 without writing anything.

  ga_ring_buffer_read reads the passed number of bytes from
  the ring buffer into the passed buffer, or until the ring buffer
  is empty. It returns the number of bytes actually read.

  ga_ring_buffer_read_atomic works like ga_ring_buffer_read,
  except it's a all-or-nothing: if the ring buffer does not
  contain the requested number of bytes, the function returns 0
  and leaves the passed buffer untouched.

  An error handler can be installed using ga_ring_buffer_set_error_callback.
  The callback should take three parameters:
    - the ring buffer [ga_ring_buffer*]
    - an error id [ga_error]
    - the data parameter passed to ga_ring_buffer_set_error_callback [void*]

  The error handler is called when
    - ga_ring_buffer_write cannot write the number of requested bytes (GA_ERROR_OVERFLOW)
    - ga_ring_buffer_read cannot read the number of requested bytes (GA_ERROR_UNDERFLOW)
