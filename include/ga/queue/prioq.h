/*****************************************************************

                NON-THREAD-SAFE PRIORITY QUEUE

  A mutable skew heap (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_heap)

  NOTE: ga_prioq is NOT thread safe!

  Nodes are reused, to minimize allocation. They can also be
  preallocated, using ga_prioq_preallocate.

  A compare function has to be provided, so that the queue knows
  how to sort its members. The compare function can look something
  like

  int cmp(void *a, void *b) {
    return ((mystruct*)a)->id - ((mystruct*)b)->id;
  }
